I"’<p>I recently subscribed to userfocus newsletter and they sent me for free a graphic instructional guide about how to moderate a usability test. I think it is very interesting and helpful, so I translated it into Greek.</p>

<p>You can get the <a href="/images/graphic_guide/testmoderation_greek.pdf">translated version</a> directly or you can subscribe to <a href="http://www.userfocus.co.uk/about/twitter.html" target="_blank">userfocus newsletter</a> and get the guide in English for free. Enjoy!</p>
