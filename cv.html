        I started as a freelancer web designer but later on, I started feeling that I want to code them myself, so I started writing HTML, CSS and jQuery when needed. 
        A couple of the websites I've designed and developed but I no longer support:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.kentro-omorfias.gr/" target="_blank">http://kentro-omorfias.gr</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://enelladi.gr/" target="_blank">http://www.enelladi.gr</a></li>
        </ul>
        <small>I can provide sample codes if needed.</small>
