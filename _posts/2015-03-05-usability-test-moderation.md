I recently subscribed to userfocus newsletter and they sent me for free a graphic instructional guide about how to moderate a usability test. I think it is very interesting and helpful, so I translated it into Greek.

You can get the [translated version](/images/graphic_guide/testmoderation_greek.pdf) directly or you can subscribe to <a href="http://www.userfocus.co.uk/about/twitter.html" target="_blank">userfocus newsletter</a> and get the guide in English for free. Enjoy!
